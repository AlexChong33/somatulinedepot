            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p id="abstract-content">An automatically retracting safety needle assembly configured to receive a syringe. The assembly has distal and proximal ends, and comprises: a housing, with internal housing (IH), and a base wall. A moving sleeve (MOS): at least partially within the IH; having a flange wall axially movable. A biasing element (BE), within the IH, biasing the MOS proximally. A syringe, receiving a plunger rod; movable axially within the IH, and coupled to the MOS. An activation fork (AF), partially disposed within the IH. AF has a guiding arm coupled with the IH and the MOS; preventing motion of the MOS during non-deployment state. An automatic retraction mechanism, retracting the syringe after injection. Deployment: advance plunger rod and the AF axially (distally), until AF guiding arm allows proximal movement of the MOS, retracting the syringe. Distal advancement of plunger rod is constant without an abrupt increase in resistive force; allowing safe disposal.</p>

        <div class="section" id="background">
            <h3>Background of the Invention</h3>
            <p id="background-problem">The invention addresses the need for safe disposal of hypodermic needles after use to prevent needle reuse, contamination, and potential injury. Specifically, it aims to overcome issues with existing safety needle assemblies where users might not fully depress the plunger due to resistance from the retraction mechanism, leading to incomplete injection and failure of the safety retraction feature.</p>
            <p id="background-prior-art-limitations">Limitations of prior art include: manual or actively implemented retraction mechanisms requiring specific user actions, which can be missed. Even with automated retractions, some designs present an abrupt increase in resistive force when activating the retraction mechanism. This can lead to users incorrectly perceiving the injection as complete, not fully depressing the plunger, resulting in incomplete dosage and failure of the needle to retract, thus posing a risk of needlestick injury and contamination. The invention aims for a constant distal advancement force for the plunger rod without an abrupt increase in resistive force to activate retraction.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="summary">
            <h3>Summary of the Invention</h3>
            <p id="summary-objectives">The present invention provides an automatically retracting safety needle assembly. The objective is to ensure safe disposal of the needle after injection by automatically retracting it into a housing. A key objective is to achieve this retraction with a deployment mechanism where the distal advancement of the plunger rod is substantially constant, without an abrupt increase in resistive force that the user must overcome to activate the retraction mechanism. This ensures full delivery of the injectant and reliable activation of the safety feature.</p>
            <p id="summary-advantages">The main advantage is enhanced safety by ensuring the needle is automatically and reliably retracted after full injection, minimizing risk of needlestick injuries and contamination. The design ensures that the user does not encounter an abrupt increase in resistive force during plunger advancement, which prevents premature stoppage of injection and ensures the retraction mechanism is properly triggered. This leads to safer disposal. The assembly can also include an indicator for injection completion and a removable needle guard for safety before use.</p>

            <h3>Analyze Operation/Method</h3>
            <p id="operation-method-description">The patent describes a method for automatically retracting a syringe (Claim 12). The general operational sequence involves:
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Providing the Assembly:</strong> The assembly is in a non-deployment state with the MOS (ROS or LOS) prevented from proximal motion by the AF. The BE is compressed between the IH base wall and the MOS flange wall, ready to bias the MOS proximally.</li>
                    <li><strong>Inserting Needle:</strong> The needle, attached to the syringe, is inserted into the injection site.</li>
                    <li><strong>Advancing Plunger Rod:</strong> The user advances the plunger rod. This action also advances the AF axially in the distal direction relative to the IH. Critically, this advancement occurs with a substantially constant force, without an abrupt increase in resistive force needed to trigger retraction (a key advantage over prior art).</li>
                    <li><strong>Activating Retraction:</strong> As the plunger rod (and thus the AF) reaches its distal-most position (end of injection), the AF's guiding arm(s) align in such a way (e.g., an activation opening aligns with a gripping snap on the MOS, or a directing protrusion moves within a guiding slot) that it no longer prevents the proximal movement of the MOS.</li>
                    <li><strong>Automatic Retraction:</strong> The biasing force of the BE then automatically moves the MOS (and the coupled syringe) proximally, retracting the needle into the housing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Securing in Retracted State:</strong> Mechanisms (specific to ROS or LOS embodiments) ensure the syringe remains retracted, preventing re-exposure of the needle and allowing for safe disposal.
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>For ROS (Claim 13-14):</strong> Release of pressing force allows the BE to move the ROS proximally. A directing protrusion in the IH guides the ROS through a helical slot, causing rotation, and then into a straight slot for axial retraction.</li>
                            <li><strong>For LOS (Claim 15-20):</strong> Advancement of the AF aligns an activation opening with a gripping snap on the LOS, allowing the snap to deflect and the LOS to move proximally. Further mechanisms, like locking snaps and windows, secure the LOS in the retracted position, preventing both further proximal and distal movement. For example, in one LOS embodiment (Claim 17), the gripping snap passes the proximal end of the IH and returns to a non-deflected state. In another (Claim 18), a locking snap on the LOS deflects through a locking opening on the AF and later engages an IH stopping protrusion. A further LOS embodiment (Claims 19-20) details interaction between an IH locking snap and first/second locking windows on the LOS to secure it post-retraction.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Safe Disposal:</strong> The assembly is now safe for disposal.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <h2>Phase 4: Identifying Novelty & Key Features</h2>
            <h3>Compare Claims & Description to Background</h3>
            <p><strong>Problems Solved:</strong> <span id="problems-solved">
                The invention aims to solve problems related to the safe disposal of hypodermic needles after use, specifically preventing needle reuse, contamination, and needlestick injuries. It addresses issues with both manual/active retraction mechanisms (requiring specific user action) and some automated mechanisms where user resistance can lead to incomplete injection or failure to activate retraction.
            </span></p>
            <p><strong>Prior Art Limitations Overcome:</strong> <span id="prior-art-overcome">
                The patent explicitly addresses limitations of prior art where users might encounter an abrupt increase in mechanical resistance when depressing the syringe plunger to activate a retraction mechanism. This resistance could lead to users incorrectly perceiving the injection as complete, resulting in incomplete dosage and failure of the needle to retract. The current invention is designed so that the distal advancement of the plunger rod is substantially constant, without an abrupt increase in resistive force to overcome for activating the retraction mechanism. This ensures the injection is fully executed before automatic retraction occurs, enhancing safety and efficacy.
            </span></p>
            <h3>Synthesize "New Features"</h3>
            <ul id="new-features-list">
                <li><strong>Constant Force Activation:</strong> A key novel feature is the retraction mechanism that activates without an abrupt increase in resistive force during plunger advancement. This ensures full dose delivery before retraction.</li>
                <li><strong>Automatic Retraction Mechanism:</strong> The core of the invention is a fully automatic (passive) or partially automated spring-based retraction mechanism that retracts the needle into the housing upon completion of injection.</li>
                <li><strong>Activation Fork (AF):</strong> The AF is a critical component that controls the timing of the retraction, preventing premature activation and ensuring it occurs only after full plunger depression. Its interaction with the Moving Sleeve (MOS) is central to the invention.</li>
                <li><strong>Moving Sleeve (MOS) - ROS/LOS Embodiments:</strong> The patent details specific embodiments of the MOS:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Rotating Sleeve (ROS):</strong> Features a guiding slot with helical and straight portions, notched flanges, and holding snaps. Its rotation and subsequent axial movement, guided by IH protrusions, facilitate retraction.</li>
                        <li><strong>Locking Sleeve (LOS):</strong> Employs gripping snaps, locking snaps, and locking windows that interact with features on the AF and IH to control and secure retraction. Different LOS embodiments offer varied locking mechanisms.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Prevention of Premature Retraction:</strong> Both ROS and LOS designs incorporate features (e.g., AF guiding arm positioning, snap/slot interactions) to ensure the MOS is held securely until the precise moment of activation at the end of injection.</li>
                <li><strong>Secure Post-Retraction Locking:</strong> Mechanisms are described (e.g., locking snaps engaging windows or protrusions) to ensure that once the needle is retracted, it is securely locked within the housing, preventing accidental re-exposure and further distal/proximal movement.</li>
                <li><strong>Indicator (Optional):</strong> The assembly may include an indicator for completion of injection, though the primary novelty lies in the constant force retraction.</li>
                <li><strong>Removable Needle Guard (Optional):</strong> For pre-use safety.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Phase 5: Understanding the Patent Statement & Scope</h2>
            <h3>Re-read Claims with Context</h3>
            <p id="claims-reread-context">
                Having analyzed the detailed description, figures, and operational method, the claims can be understood as protecting an automatically retracting safety needle assembly designed for enhanced user safety and reliable operation. The core inventive concept revolves around a retraction mechanism (particularly involving the AF and MOS interaction) that activates upon full injection completion without requiring the user to overcome a significant, abrupt increase in force. This addresses a key prior art limitation. The independent claims (1 and 12) broadly define the essential components and method, while dependent claims add specific structural or functional refinements to the MOS (ROS and LOS embodiments), their locking mechanisms, and interactions with the IH and AF. The language "comprising" in the claims suggests an open-ended interpretation, meaning assemblies with additional, unlisted elements could still infringe if all claimed elements are present.

            <h3>Review Prosecution History (If Available - PAIR)</h3>
            <p id="prosecution-history-notes">(To be filled if PAIR information is accessed - This would provide insights into claim amendments, examiner objections, and arguments made, further refining the understanding of claim scope and enforceability.)</p>
            <h3>Identify Potential Gaps/Limitations</h3>
            <p id="gaps-limitations">
                Potential gaps or limitations could include:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Material Specificity:</strong> The claims are generally not limited to specific materials for the components, potentially allowing design-arounds using different materials if they achieve the same functional outcome without infringing on specific material-dependent claims (if any were present, though not prominent here).</li>
                    <li><strong>Manufacturing Methods:</strong> The claims focus on the apparatus and its method of use, not typically on the methods of manufacturing the components themselves.</li>
                    <li><strong>Specific Drug Formulations:</strong> The patent claims the device, not the drug it delivers. Compatibility with highly viscous drugs or specific drug container requirements not explicitly covered could be a limitation or area for further innovation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Alternative Activation Mechanisms:</strong> While the AF and MOS interaction is key, significantly different mechanical or electro-mechanical approaches to achieve constant-force automatic retraction might fall outside the claim scope.</li>
                    <li><strong>User Interface/Ergonomics:</strong> While functionality is covered, specific ergonomic designs or user interface elements beyond the core mechanism might not be explicitly protected unless detailed in dependent claims.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p><strong>Focus of Claims (Mechanical/Formulation):</strong> <span id="claims-focus">
                The claims are overwhelmingly focused on the <strong>mechanical aspects</strong> of the safety needle assembly (apparatus claims) and its method of operation (method claims). There are no claims directed towards drug formulations.
            </span></p>
            <p><strong>Desirable Features in Dependent Claims:</strong> <span id="dependent-claims-features">
                Many dependent claims cover desirable features that enhance the core invention or provide specific embodiments:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>ROS Specifics (Claims 3-6, 13-14):</strong> Details of the rotating sleeve's guiding slots, notched flanges, and interaction with IH protrusions offer a specific, potentially robust retraction mechanism.</li>
                    <li><strong>LOS Specifics (Claims 7-11, 15-20):</strong> Various LOS embodiments with different gripping/locking snap configurations and window interactions provide alternative, secure locking mechanisms post-retraction. These offer design flexibility and potentially different manufacturing or performance characteristics.</li>
                    <li><strong>Specific Locking Features:</strong> Claims detailing how the MOS (ROS or LOS) is locked after retraction (e.g., Claim 6 for ROS, Claims 9, 11, 18, 20 for LOS variations) are crucial for ensuring safety and preventing needle re-exposure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Indicator (Claim not explicitly numbered but mentioned in summary):</strong> While not a primary focus of the claims themselves, the potential inclusion of an indicator is a desirable usability feature.</li>
                    <li><strong>Removable Needle Guard (Claim not explicitly numbered but mentioned in summary):</strong> Adds pre-use safety.</li>
                </ul>
